! SUBPROGRAM: IW3JDN         COMPUTE JULIAN DAY NUMBER
!   AUTHOR: JONES,R.E.       ORG: W342       DATE: 87-03-29
!
! ABSTRACT: COMPUTES JULIAN DAY NUMBER FROM YEAR (4 DIGITS), MONTH,
!   AND DAY. IW3JDN IS VALID FOR YEARS 1583 A.D. TO 3300 A.D.
!   JULIAN DAY NUMBER CAN BE USED TO COMPUTE DAY OF WEEK, DAY OF
!   YEAR, RECORD NUMBERS IN AN ARCHIVE, REPLACE DAY OF CENTURY,
!   FIND THE NUMBER OF DAYS BETWEEN TWO DATES.
!
! PROGRAM HISTORY LOG:
!   87-03-29  R.E.JONES
!   89-10-25  R.E.JONES   CONVERT TO CRAY CFT77 FORTRAN
!
! USAGE:   II = IW3JDN(IYEAR,MONTH,IDAY)
!
!   INPUT VARIABLES:

!     ------ --------- -----------------------------------------------
!     IYEAR  ARG LIST  INTEGER   YEAR           ( 4 DIGITS)
!     MONTH  ARG LIST  INTEGER   MONTH OF YEAR   (1 - 12)
!     IDAY   ARG LIST  INTEGER   DAY OF MONTH    (1 - 31)

!     IW3JDN FUNTION   INTEGER   JULIAN DAY NUMBER
!                      JAN. 1,1960 IS JULIAN DAY NUMBER 2436935
!                      JAN. 1,1987 IS JULIAN DAY NUMBER 2446797
!
!   REMARKS: JULIAN PERIOD WAS DEVISED BY JOSEPH SCALIGER IN 1582.
!     JULIAN DAY NUMBER #1 STARTED ON JAN. 1,4713 B.C. THREE MAJOR
!     CHRONOLOGICAL CYCLES BEGIN ON THE SAME DAY. A 28-YEAR SOLAR
!     CYCLE, A 19-YEAR LUNER CYCLE, A 15-YEAR INDICTION CYCLE, USED
!     IN ANCIENT ROME TO REGULATE TAXES. IT WILL TAKE 7980 YEARS
!     TO COMPLETE THE PERIOD, THE PRODUCT OF 28, 19, AND 15.
!     SCALIGER NAMED THE PERIOD, DATE, AND NUMBER AFTER HIS FATHER
!     JULIUS (NOT AFTER THE JULIAN CALENDAR). THIS SEEMS TO HAVE
!     CAUSED A LOT OF CONFUSION IN TEXT BOOKS. SCALIGER NAME IS
!     SPELLED THREE DIFFERENT WAYS. JULIAN DATE AND JULIAN DAY
!     NUMBER ARE INTERCHANGED. A JULIAN DATE IS USED BY ASTRONOMERS
!     TO COMPUTE ACCURATE TIME, IT HAS A FRACTION. WHEN TRUNCATED TO
!     AN INTEGER IT IS CALLED AN JULIAN DAY NUMBER. THIS FUNCTION
!     WAS IN A LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF THE COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
!     VOLUME 11 / NUMBER 10 / OCTOBER 1968. THE JULIAN DAY NUMBER
!     CAN BE CONVERTED TO A YEAR, MONTH, DAY, DAY OF WEEK, DAY OF
!     YEAR BY CALLING SUBROUTINE W3FS26.
