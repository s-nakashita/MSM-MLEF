This sys/ directory contains all the required scripts, source codes, and
constant dataset used for model pre-processing, integration, and post
processing. This sys/ has to be configured and its libraries and utilities
have to be installed. Once it has be installed with success, then it can 
be used for multiple users and multiple experiments under usr/. Based on
this concern, this sys/ should be installed by much more experienced 
users or called sytem user.

To install this system, under sys/, one can issue ./job/install_sys,
then the script will ask for machine type with lists for you to type in.
After you type the correct selection, the installation will start by its
own and showing its procedures, and finally give you normal end response. 

The purpose of each sub-directory can be described as following:

fix/	contains all necessary fixed/constant dataset 
	GTOPO30/	conatins 30 second topography data
inp/	contains some examples initial conditions
