This usr/ directory contains only two sub-directories; one is doc/ and
the other is exp/. The purpose of usr/ is for user to hold his or her
user documentation, personal note etc in doc/ and personal experiments 
in exp/. The contains of subdirectories can be described as following:

doc/	contains all documentations in several different forms, such as
	text form with subflix .txt which can be viewed by UNIX command
	vi or view; doc form which can be viewed by wordprocessor, and
	pdf form which can be viewed by display utilities for pdf.
        In this release, we include a file called FFTableforRSM.pdf
        which provides the numbers for RSM to use as number of grid
        spacing in any given horizontal domain side, say east-west or
        south-north side.

exp/	contains examples of experiments, where
	gfsp2rsm/	use NCEPgfs grib pressure files as input and 
			boundary to create regional domain data
	gfss2rsm/	use NCEPgfs binary model layers data for input
			and boundary to create regional domain data
	gsm2rsm/	use global model output as input and boundary
			to run regional model (hydrostatic)
	gfsp2rsm27/	use NCEPgfs grib pressure files as input and 
			boundary to create regional 27km domain data
	cwbgfsp2rsm27/	use CWB gfs grib pressure files as input and 
			boundary to create regional 27km domain data
	rsm2rsm27/	use regional model output as input and boundary 
			to run 27km (d01) regional model (hydrostatic)
	rsm2msm9/	use regional model output as input and boundary 
			to run 9km (d02) mesoscale model (nonhydrostatic)
	rsm2msm3/	use regional model output as input and boundary 
			to run 3km (d03) mesoscale model (nonhydrostatic)
	msm2msm/	use mesoscale model output as input and 
			boundary to run mesoscale model
	msm_move/	regional or mesoscale model output as input and 
			boundary to run movable domain by route defined
	msm_zuoying/	regional or mesoscale model output as input and 
			boundary to run fine mesoscale model on Zhouyin harbor
	msm_dongsha/	regional or mesoscale model output as input and 
			boundary to run fine mesoscale model on Donsa island
	msm_taiping/	regional or mesoscale model output as input and 
			boundary to run fine mesoscale model on Taipin island
	prepare_terrain/ to prepare terrain data from raw orographic
			data of different kinds, especially for fine
			resolution later

Note that gfs is getting from NCEP gfs dataset from internet, gsm is
local-run global model which is planned to implement later in future
staged versions. rsm is hydrostatic regional spectral model, and msm
is nonhydrostatic mesoscale spectral model. Only rsm2rsm27/, rsm2msm9/, 
rsm2msm3/, msm_move/, msm_zuoying, msm_dongsha/, and msm_taiping/ are all
fully tested with high resolution terrain data of GTOPO30 (30 sec).

It is a user defined place, one can make any subdirectory and name it
as one's like, for example, one can have exp1/, exp2/, etc for different
experiments, or put exp/gfsp2rsm_case1, exp/rsm2msm_case1, ..../case2, ..
../case3 etc. The system has been tested under the second naming patterns
for experiments, but to use the first naming/organization method is
possible by alternating some definition of the directory names in file
configure under each directory.
