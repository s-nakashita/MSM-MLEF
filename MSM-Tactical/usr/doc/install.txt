                               INSTALL

1. install lib
cd lib/src
edit compile.sh and choose MACHINE
./compile.sh

If you use the machine we don't support, you need install the following library manually.
jasper-1.900.1 libpng-1.2.40 zlib-1.2.3 bacio w3lib-1.7 g2 

1) install jasper-1.900.1
assume WORK is your rsm trunk directory.
./configure $WORK/lib
make
make install
mv $WORK/lib/include/* $WORK/lib/incmod/
mv $WORK/lib/lib/* $WORK/lib

2) install libpng-1.2.40
./configure $WORK/lib
make
make install
mv $WORK/lib/include/* $WORK/lib/incmod/
mv $WORK/lib/lib/* $WORK/lib

2. compile utl
cd utl
vi compile
change MACHINE
./compile

3. compile rsm_pgrb
cd src/rsm_pgrb.fd
make -f makefile_awips_XXX

4. set up a case
you can follow the test cases under exp to set up your case.
Now we only test gfsp2rsm gfss2rsm and rsm2msm.

gfsp2rsm  preprocess GFS pressure level data to RSM background
gfss2rsm  preprocess GFS sigma level data to RSM background
rsm2msm   do RSM nonhydrostatic run using RSM backgroud
