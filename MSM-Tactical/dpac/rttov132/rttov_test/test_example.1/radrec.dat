!
! Define list of channels for which to reconstruct radiances
!
! The first integer is the number of channels:
! Negative number => turn off radiance reconstruction
! Zero => reconstruct all channels
! Positive number => the number of channels, followed by the channel list
!
!
! Examples:
!
! No radiance reconstruction:
! -1
!
! Reconstruct all channels:
! 0
!
! Reconstruct a specific set of 10 channels:
! 10
! 93 137 185 237 285 349 413 1013 1533 2289
!
!
! For this test case, reconstruct all channels:
